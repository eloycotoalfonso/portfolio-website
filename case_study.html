      <h1>Case Study: Full-Stack Project</h1>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Overview</h2>
      <img src = "img/case_of_study/1.png" class ="myFlix_index" alt = "myFlix index image"/>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        myFlix is a web app, developed using
        the MERN stack. 
        It provides users with
        access to information to a magazine of
        movies. Each movie contents extra
        information about the director and the
        genre. Users are able to create and log
        in into an account, update their
        personal data and easily create a list of
        favorite movies.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Purspose & Context</h2>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        MyFlix is a personal project developed
        within the structure of my web development course at CareerFoundry to
        demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Objective</h2>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full stack project that I can
        add to my professional portfolio, building a complete server-side and client-side application from scratch.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Approach</h2>
      <h3>Server-Side</h3>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. This API interacts with a
        non-relational database (allocated in MondoDB). The API can be accessed via
        commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and
        store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API returns the
        information in a JSON format.
      </p>
      <div class = server_side_images>
        <img src = "img/case_of_study/2.png" class = "myFlix_postman" alt = "myFlix postman image"/>
        <img src = "img/case_of_study/3.png" class ="myFlix_code" alt = "myFlix code image"/>
      </div>
      <h3>Client-Side</h3>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        After completing the API and make sure that the endpoints are properly
        working, I started building the interface users would need to interact with the
        server-side. The application is a single-page, responsive application,
        developed with React. It provides several interface views, including but not
        limited to, a main view (which shows a list of all movies available in the
        database), single movie view (returns data specific to a particular movie
        including a link to the director and genre information views, and also allows
        users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration
        view and a profile view (where users can update their data, check out their
        list of favorites or remove a movie from their favorites).
      </p>
      <div class = "client_side_images">
        <div class= "client_side_images__item">
          <img src = "img/case_of_study/4.png" class ="client_side_images__item" alt = "myFlix director image"/>
        </div>
        <div class= "client_side_images__item">
          <img src = "img/case_of_study/6.png" class ="client_side_images__item" alt = "myFlix login image"/>
          
        </div>
        <div class= "client_side_images__item">
          <img src = "img/case_of_study/5.png" class ="client_side_images__item" alt = "myFlix profile image"/>
        </div> 
      </div>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Duration</h2>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        The development of the client-side took me around three times longer as creating
        the server-side. On the one side I wanted to make sure I had a good grasp
        on how React works and achieve a desired result. On the other hand I faced
        some problems while uploading it to the platform that made the application
        perfectly work locally but not when uploaded online.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "study_case_title">Retrospective</h2>
      <h3>What went well?</h3>
      <p class = "study_case_text">
        This was both my favorite and most challenging project. I have enjoyed
        building the API and working with the Database structures, as well as getting
        a full grasp of how a web works from what a user interacts with to where the
        information is permanently storage, going through every single step of the
        project while working in a topic (movies) which is one of my hobbies. Also,
        since this was the biggest project of the course, approximately 50% of the
        total time, is the project with which I got more engaged.
      </p>
      <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
      <p class = "study_case_text"> 
          The compatibility of the versions that I used in my local was anything but
          perfect, so I found multiple errors that took me a while to realize that werenâ€™t
          in the code itself but in them. With the help of my tutor and especially my
          mentor though three video call meetings (>1h) we could figure out what the
          problem was and eventually find a package of libraries that worked fine both
          locally and online.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Steps</h3>
        <p class = "study_case_text">
          I would like to include some features such as not only a list of favorite movies
          but also a list of movies to watch, a list of movies watched and maybe featured
          series. Or even implement a algorithm that based on your favorites movies
          suggest you a tailored list instead of a list of all movies.

          <img src = "img/case_of_study/7.png" class ="myFlix_movie" alt = "myFlix movie image"/>
        </div>
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p class = "study_case_text">
          Even though in my opinion, this is not a final product, since for that it should
          have a much bigger magazine of movies and the application being able to, at
          least save the movies that you have watched and the movies you want to
          watch, I am overall happy with the result of the project not only because I
          enjoyed working for it but also because I have got a deep understanding of
          the process of building a website while learning multiple different skills
          needed for being a web developer.
